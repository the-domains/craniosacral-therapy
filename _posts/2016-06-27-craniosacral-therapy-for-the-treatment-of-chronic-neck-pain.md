  Objectives: With growing evidence for the effectiveness of craniosacral
  therapy (CST) for pain management, the efficacy of CST remains unclear. This
  study therefore aimed at investigating CST in comparison with sham treatment
  in chronic nonspecific neck pain patients. Materials and Methods: A total of
  54 blinded patients were randomized into either 8 weekly units of CST or
  light-touch sham treatment.
